# Go-Portfolio

- [quoter](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/quoter): A CLI program using the standard library _flags_ package instead of a batteries-included package like _cobra_. The principles behind testing and structuring still remain the same though.

- [http-client](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/immersive-go-course/tree/main/projects/output-and-error-handling): A simple client for an HTTP server.

- [http-client playground](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/Go-Playground/tree/main/http-client): Playing around with Go's http.Client.

- [http-server playground](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/Go-Playground/tree/main/http-server): Playing around with Go's http.Server.

- [http-server structured](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/Go-Playground/tree/main/http-server-clean): A minimal http-server implementation with separation of concerns.

- [production-grade-http-server](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/Go-Playground/tree/main/production-grade-api-server): (In-Progress) A production grade HTTP server in Go.
